Problem
Given any two members in a family tree display the relationship of the first person to the second person.  Ie. George is the great grandparent of Stephen; or Jackson is the child of Emily.
The family tree to use for this project is modelled here.  Notice that not all parts of the tree are visible until you select specific people.
Design (80%)
Using words and/or drawings/diagrams, articulate the design of your algorithm for the solving the problem
Write pseudo code for your algorithm
Determine the runtime efficiency/complexity of your algorithm using Big-O notation
Comment on any trade offs you have considered in designing your algorithm
Submit all your design docs/diagrams/pseudo code
Anyone should be able to look at this design/pseudo code and implement the algorithm in whatever language they choose
Implementation (20%)
Using any programming language you wish implement your algorithm
The program displays the list of people in the tree in some way
The user shall be asked to select 2 people from the list
The program shows the relationship between the two people selected
If the above tasks are too easy then go beyond and generalise your algorithm to calculate the relationship (term) between two family members given a natural language query like:
Q: My parent’s sibling’s child
A: is my cousin
Q: My cousin’s child
A: is my first cousin once removed
Q: My great aunt/uncle’s grandchild
A: is my second cousin

Criteria
Level 1
Level 2
Level 3
Level 4

Design
Entities and their properties are defined to cover the problem.
Pseudocode is written for key algorithms in the game.
Pseudocode uses consistent terminology/language; covers most scenarios.
Pseudocode covers edge cases.

Functionality
Program accepts user input and produces output related to the problem.

Immediate family relationships are handled.
Family tree is configurable (ie. the solution is not tailored to a fixed tree).
Relationships with at least 4 degrees of separation are handled.
All relationships are handled.

Efficiency
Worse than polynomial complexity or very few scenarios are handled.
Polynomial complexity or only some scenarios are handled.
Loglinear complexity and most scenarios handled.
Better than loglinear complexity and all scenarios handled.

Quality
Some documentation of features and functionality.
Documentations are free of spelling and grammatical errors
Documentations are accurate.

Names of variables, functions, etc. are accurate.
Documentations are expressive and thoughtful, keeping the audience in mind.

Documentation includes future plans or areas of improvement  for the project.
